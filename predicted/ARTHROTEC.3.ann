T3	Drug 121 623	Pain so bad it disrupted my sleep co pletely. also, extreme itching on legs and arms, so bad I scrathced myself raw. mobility has DECREASED rapidly, especially when trying to go down stairs. Was warned about possibility of constipation but think doctor underestimated how severe it would get. Arthrotec was supposed to ease my pain not make it worse. Have stopped taking and immediatedly muscle/joint pain eased and sleeping much better. Have reverted to use of co-codamol to ease symptoms as required.
